## Web Phase 1 — COMPLETE

**Theme:** Complete Data Layer & Core Loop Alignment

### Deliverables

| Area | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Pet Data** | ✅ | 8 pets with unique abilities (Munchlet, Grib, Plompo, Fizz, Ember, Chomper, Whisp, Luxe) |
| **Food Data** | ✅ | 10 foods with complete 80-entry affinity matrix |
| **Pet Unlock System** | ✅ | Starter pets (3) + unlock requirements for 5 premium pets |
| **Ability System** | ✅ | All 8 pet abilities implemented and tested |
| **Store Integration** | ✅ | Zustand store with pet selection, unlocking, feeding |
| **Evolution Thresholds** | ✅ | Aligned: Baby 1-9, Youth 10-24, Evolved 25+ |
| **Documentation** | ✅ | Bible §6.1, README, and backlog all synchronized |
| **Test Coverage** | ✅ | 102 Vitest tests passing |

### Evolution Threshold Alignment (P1-DOC-1)

| Stage | Old Bible | Code (SoT) | New Bible |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Baby | 1-6 | 1-9 | 1-9 |
| Youth | 7-12 | 10-24 | 10-24 |
| Evolved | 13+ | 25+ | 25+ |

**Rationale:** Code wins for pacing. Slower evolution aligns with "Curved progression — fast early, slow late" design philosophy (Bible §6.2).

### Exit Criteria Met

| All 8 abilities implemented | ✅ |
| All tests pass (`npm test -- --run`) | ✅ |
| Build passes (`npm run build`) | ✅ |
| Bible/Code/README aligned | ✅ |

### Remaining Polish (Low Priority)

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
