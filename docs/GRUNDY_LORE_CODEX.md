## Short World Intro (FTUE Copy)

**This is the approved short-form backstory used in the onboarding flow:**

> Sometimes, when a big feeling is left behind…
> A tiny spirit called a Grundy wakes up.
> One of them just found *you*.

*Lines appear sequentially with fade-in animation. This copy is LOCKED.*

---

## On the Nature of Grundies

*From the journal of an unnamed naturalist, water-damaged, date unknown:*

> They are not born. They do not hatch. They simply *are*, suddenly, in places where a feeling was strong enough to leave something behind.
>
> I have spent years trying to understand their origins. The closest I can describe: imagine an emotion so pure it forgets to disappear. Joy. Hunger. Peace. Chaos. The feeling passes — but something small remains.
>
> That something opens its eyes.

---

> *"Where do they come from?"*
> *"From the moments we forget to hold onto."*
> — Common folk saying, origin unknown

---

## The Eight Known Varieties

*Taxonomic classifications are futile. They resist categorization. But patterns emerge.*

---

## 🟡 MUNCHLET
**Classification:** Hearthspirit, Common  
**Title:** "The Friendly One"  
**First Documented:** Sunny windowsills, kitchen corners, warm places

### Fragment I — Discovery
*From a child's letter, found pressed in a cookbook:*

> There was something on the windowsill today. Yellow like butter. It was humming even though it has no mouth for humming. Mama says I can keep it.

### Fragment II — Formation
*Academic notation, author disputed:*

> Munchlets crystallize from **sustained comfort** — not a single moment, but accumulated warmth. They are more common in homes with:
> - Regular meals eaten together
> - Sunlight through south-facing windows  
> - The smell of baking
>
> They appear to *wait* before revealing themselves. Patience is fundamental to their nature.

### Fragment III — Observed Behaviors
- Hums at frequencies that induce calm in nearby humans
- Physically dims when isolated for extended periods
- Cannot regulate internal temperature; seeks external warmth
- Follows movement with entire body, not just eyes

### Fragment IV — The Waiting
*Handwritten addendum, different ink:*

> I asked one how long it had waited on that windowsill before the family noticed.
>
> It didn't answer. They never do.
>
> But something in its eyes suggested: *longer than I want to remember.*

### Origin Snippet (In-Game)
> Found on a sunny windowsill, humming.
> Waiting for someone to share warmth with.

### Known Preferences
| Drawn To | Repelled By |
|----------|-------------|
| Sweetness | Solitude |
| Company | Cold |
| Warmth | Spice |

### Secret (Hidden Lore)
> Munchlet remembers being alone before you found them. They don't talk about it, but it's why they light up so bright when you come back.

---

## 🟢 GRIB
**Classification:** Shadowspirit, Uncommon  
**Title:** "The Mischievous One"  
**First Documented:** Cupboard corners, beneath stairs, places adults forget to look

### Fragment I — First Sighting
*Incident report, municipal archive:*

> Homeowner reported "something grinning" in the pantry. Investigation found no intruder. Suggested drafty window causing imagination.
>
> [Marginal note in red: *They never find them when they look. Gribs only appear when they want to.*]

### Fragment II — Formation
*From "A Study of Chaos-Adjacent Entities," Chapter 7:*

> Unlike comfort-spirits, Gribs emerge from **disorder with joy** — specifically, the moment when something goes wrong and everyone laughs anyway.
>
> A dropped cake at a birthday party. A spectacular failed prank. The crash that precedes relief.
>
> The chaos must be *harmless*. Gribs do not form from true disaster — only from delightful mischief.

### Fragment III — Observed Behaviors
- Relocates small objects; returns them days later
- Emits clicking vocalization ("kekeke") when amused
- Demonstrates preference for elevated vantage points
- Maintains eye contact longer than comfortable

### Fragment IV — The Choosing
*Personal correspondence, heavily redacted:*

> People think Gribs are random. That they appear anywhere shadows gather.
>
> They're wrong.
>
> Gribs *watch first*. Sometimes for weeks. They're selecting someone who can handle them. Someone who won't break when things get interesting.
>
> If a Grib chose you — you passed a test you didn't know you were taking.

### Origin Snippet (In-Game)
> Appeared in a shadow behind the cupboard, grinning.
> Not telling how.

### Known Preferences
| Drawn To | Repelled By |
|----------|-------------|
| Chaos | Boredom |
| Spice | Predictability |
| Reactions | Sweetness |

### Secret (Hidden Lore)
> Grib chose you specifically. They watched from the shadows for a while first. You seemed like someone who could handle a little chaos.

---

## 🟣 PLOMPO
**Classification:** Cloudspirit, Common  
**Title:** "The Sleepy One"  
**First Documented:** Low-hanging clouds, foggy mornings, recently-vacated warm beds

### Fragment I — The Drifting
*Weather observation log, coastal station:*

> 0600 — Unusual low cloud formation against eastern window.
> 0615 — Cloud appears to contain... something. Purple. Sleeping.
> 0700 — Cloud dissipated. Creature remains. Still sleeping.
> 0900 — Still sleeping.

### Fragment II — Formation
*Excerpt from "On Dreams and Their Residue":*

> Plompos condense from **perfect rest** — the weighted warmth before sleep, the reluctance to wake, the sacred laziness of a day with no demands.
>
> They are, in essence, naps given form.
>
> It is unclear if they are always sleeping or simply always *appear* to be sleeping. Research inconclusive; subjects fell asleep during observation.

### Fragment III — Observed Behaviors
- Terminal velocity significantly lower than expected for mass
- Can sleep in any position, on any surface
- Responds to stimuli on significant delay (2-4 seconds)
- Emits soft vocalizations ("mrrrp") when disturbed

### Fragment IV — The Other Place
*Dream journal, anonymous, found in used bookstore:*

> My Plompo mumbles in its sleep. I used to think it was nonsense.
>
> Then I heard it clearly: *"Two moons tonight."*
>
> We only have one moon.
>
> Where do they go when they dream?

### Origin Snippet (In-Game)
> Discovered sleeping in a cloud that drifted too low.
> Went back to sleep.

### Known Preferences
| Drawn To | Repelled By |
|----------|-------------|
| Rest | Haste |
| Softness | Noise |
| Quiet | Rough textures |

### Secret (Hidden Lore)
> Plompo dreams vividly and sometimes mumbles about places they've seen — clouds shaped like castles, skies with two moons. They've been somewhere else, once.

---

## 🔵 FIZZ
**Classification:** Stormspirit, Uncommon  
**Title:** "The Electric One"  
**First Documented:** During electrical storms, near charged equipment, at moments of peak anticipation

### Fragment I — Manifestation
*Emergency services transcript:*

> CALLER: There's something in my living room. It appeared during the lightning.
> DISPATCH: Can you describe it?
> CALLER: Blue. Spiky. It won't stop *moving*.
> DISPATCH: Is it aggressive?
> CALLER: No, it's just — it's so *excited*. About everything. It's exhausting to watch.

### Fragment II — Formation
*From "Electrical Anomalies and Emotional Resonance":*

> Fizzes spark into existence at the **peak of anticipation** — not the event itself, but the moment before. The held breath. The crackle of "something's about to happen."
>
> They are literally made of excitement.
>
> This explains their inability to remain still. Stillness is antithetical to their composition.

### Fragment III — Observed Behaviors
- Generates measurable static discharge when stimulated
- Vibration frequency correlates with emotional state
- Cannot maintain focus on single subject beyond 10 seconds
- Demonstrates visible distress when required to wait

### Fragment IV — The Fear
*Personal journal, stained with what appears to be tears:*

> I finally understood my Fizz today.
>
> It's not just energetic. It's *afraid*.
>
> Afraid of stopping. Afraid that if it slows down, even for a moment, the spark will go out and it won't come back.
>
> So it burns and burns and burns. Just in case.

### Origin Snippet (In-Game)
> Sparked into existence during a thunderstorm.
> Hasn't stopped vibrating.

### Known Preferences
| Drawn To | Repelled By |
|----------|-------------|
| Excitement | Waiting |
| Action | Stillness |
| Stimulation | Quiet |

### Secret (Hidden Lore)
> Fizz is afraid of running out of energy. Not in a game-stat way — they're scared that one day the spark will just... stop. So they burn bright while they can.

---

## 🟠 EMBER
**Classification:** Flamespirit, Rare  
**Title:** "The Proud One"  
**First Documented:** Dying fires, ceremonial flames, anywhere fire fights to survive

### Fragment I — The Last Light
*Recovered from a burned journal, only page intact:*

> The fire was almost out. One coal left, barely glowing.
>
> I went to add kindling — but something in the ember *looked at me*.
>
> It refused to go dark. Out of spite, I think.
>
> Now it lives in my home and expects to be admired.

### Fragment II — Formation
*"On Spirits of Defiance," academic treatise:*

> Embers do not form from fire itself — fire is common and dies easily.
>
> Embers form from **the refusal to die**. The last coal. The spark that should have failed but didn't. The stubborn insistence on existing when extinction was certain.
>
> This explains their temperament. They have already survived the end once. They will never be small again.

### Fragment III — Observed Behaviors
- Flame-crown intensity correlates directly with mood
- Requires acknowledgment upon entering spaces
- Physically warmer to the touch when pleased
- Refuses sustenance deemed "beneath standards"

### Fragment IV — The Memory
*Fragment, found in fireplace ashes, partly burned:*

> Never ask an Ember about before.
>
> Before, they were almost nothing. A spark. A moment from disappearing.
>
> They built themselves from that nothing into something that demands to be seen.
>
> The pride isn't arrogance.
>
> It's armor.

### Origin Snippet (In-Game)
> Emerged from the last ember of a dying fire.
> Refuses to be ignored.

### Known Preferences
| Drawn To | Repelled By |
|----------|-------------|
| Attention | Being ignored |
| Quality | Mediocrity |
| Recognition | Cold |

### Secret (Hidden Lore)
> Ember was almost nothing once. A spark that nearly went out. They'll never be that small again — but they remember how it felt.

---

## 🔴 CHOMPER
**Classification:** Appetitespirit, Common  
**Title:** "The Hungry One"  
**First Documented:** Kitchens, dining rooms, anywhere food is prepared or consumed

### Fragment I — Arrival
*Domestic incident report:*

> Subject appeared at kitchen threshold approximately 1800 hours, coinciding with dinner preparation. Made no hostile movements. Made no movements at all except *looking at the food*.
>
> Has not left since. (Three weeks.)
>
> Is this an infestation? Please advise.

### Fragment II — Formation
*From "Simple Spirits: A Study in Elemental Desires":*

> The Chomper is perhaps the purest manifestation documented. It forms from **uncomplicated appetite** — not greed, not desperation, simply the joy of eating and the anticipation of meals.
>
> Researchers initially theorized complex motivations.
>
> Further study confirmed: it really is just about food.

### Fragment III — Observed Behaviors
- Responds to food-related sounds from significant distances
- Lacks documented food aversions (unique among all varieties)
- Produces notable gastric vocalizations regardless of satiation state
- Occasionally attempts consumption of non-food items (correctable)

### Fragment IV — The Simplicity
*Personal reflection, found in recipe book margins:*

> Everyone overcomplicates Chomper.
>
> "What does it want?" Food.
> "What does it fear?" Not-food.
> "What makes it happy?" Being full.
>
> There's something beautiful about a creature that knows exactly what it wants and feels no shame in wanting it.
>
> We should all be so honest.

### Origin Snippet (In-Game)
> First spotted near the kitchen, following the smell of dinner.
> Loves food. Hates... just loves food.

### Known Preferences
| Drawn To | Repelled By |
|----------|-------------|
| Food | *(See "Drawn To")* |

### Secret (Hidden Lore)
> Chomper can technically survive without eating as much as they do. They're just happiest when full, and they've decided to optimize for happiness.

## ⚪ WHISP
**Classification:** Dreamspirit, Rare  
**Title:** "The Mysterious One"  
**First Documented:** Liminal spaces, twilight hours, beside sleeping humans

### Fragment I — The Crack
*Sleep study notes, patient 7:*

> Patient reported waking to find entity at bedside. Translucent. White. Patient initially believed still dreaming.
>
> Entity remained after patient confirmed wakefulness.
>
> Entity appeared "confused about which side of the dream it was on."

### Fragment II — Formation
*"The Permeable Boundary: Spirits of the Threshold":*

> Whisps emerge from **the space between** — not from sleep and not from waking, but from the membrane that separates them. The moment when you cannot be certain which world you're in.
>
> They are partially *here* and partially *elsewhere*.
>
> Where "elsewhere" is remains unknown. Whisps do not explain. It is unclear if they can.

### Fragment III — Observed Behaviors
- Opacity fluctuates with emotional state (more solid when content)
- Locomotion is drift-based; does not contact floor
- Occasionally phases through solid matter (appears involuntary)
- Orients toward empty spaces as if perceiving stimuli

### Fragment IV — The Other World
*Recording transcript, timestamp corrupted:*

> RESEARCHER: Where did you come from?
> [No audible response]
> RESEARCHER: Can you show me?
> [Subject drifts toward window, stops]
> [Long pause]
> RESEARCHER: What's wrong?
> [Subject turns back. Shakes head slowly.]
>
> *Note: Subject appeared to be choosing. Choosing to stay here.*

### Fragment V — The Thinness
*Handwritten, no attribution:*

> Whisp looked at nothing today. Stared at an empty corner for an hour.
>
> I asked what it saw.
>
> It didn't answer. But it moved closer to me afterward.
>
> I think it's trying to stay anchored.
>
> I think it's afraid of drifting back.

### Origin Snippet (In-Game)
> Drifted in through a crack in a dream.
> Sometimes forgets which world.

### Known Preferences
| Drawn To | Repelled By |
|----------|-------------|
| Quiet | Loud sounds |
| Softness | Chaos |
| Gentle routine | Harsh light |

### Secret (Hidden Lore)
> Whisp isn't sure which world they belong to anymore. Yours or the other one, the one they came from. Most days, they choose yours.

---

## ✨ LUXE
**Classification:** Unknown, Rare  
**Title:** "The Fancy One"  
**First Documented:** Inexplicably, already present when documentation began

### Fragment I — The Arrival
*Social column clipping, date obscured:*

> A peculiar creature was observed at [LOCATION REDACTED] this evening, positioned near the grand entrance as if awaiting introduction.
>
> When asked its origin, it offered only a look that suggested the question was beneath answering.
>
> It sparkles. It does not explain why.

### Fragment II — Formation
*From "Spirits of Uncertain Origin" (incomplete manuscript):*

> Luxe presents a taxonomic challenge. Most spirits form from emotional moments. Luxe appears to form from **the appreciation of quality itself** — the recognition that some things are simply finer than others.
>
> Alternatively: Luxe may have invented this explanation.
>
> We cannot verify. Luxe declines to cooperate with research it deems "tedious."

### Fragment III — Observed Behaviors
- Produces natural luminescence; source unidentified
- Performs non-verbal judgments on surroundings constantly
- Refuses sustenance below perceived quality threshold
- Dispenses approval sparingly; approval highly valued by recipients

### Fragment IV — The Backstory
*Interview notes, marked "CONFIDENTIAL":*

> I made the mistake of asking Luxe about its past.
>
> It described a glamorous origin. Crystal towers. Admiring crowds.
>
> Later, I asked again.
>
> Different story. Equally glamorous.
>
> The third time, it simply looked away.
>
> I think the truth is something it has decided not to remember.

### Fragment V — What Luxe Was
*Anonymous submission, found under door:*

> Before Luxe was Luxe, it was small.
>
> Before it sparkled, it was dull.
>
> Before it was certain of its worth, it was lost and afraid and ordinary.
>
> So it decided — *decided* — to become something that would never feel that way again.
>
> The glamour isn't inherited. It's constructed. Deliberately. Defiantly.
>
> That makes it more impressive, not less.

### Origin Snippet (In-Game)
> Arrived already posing.
> Certain they deserve better.

### Known Preferences
| Drawn To | Repelled By |
|----------|-------------|
| Luxury | The ordinary |
| Quality | The common |
| Admiration | Being overlooked |

### Secret (Hidden Lore)
> Luxe doesn't actually remember where they came from. They invented their own backstory — something suitably glamorous. The truth is they were small and lost once, and they decided to become someone who would never feel that way again.

## Shared Lore & World Rules

### How Grundies Choose Their Person

They don't explain. They just know. Something in the home calls to them — a need that matches what they can give.

*From a lecture, transcribed poorly:*

> You don't find a Grundy. A Grundy finds you. The question isn't "how do I get one?" The question is "am I ready for one to arrive?"

### Can You Have Multiple Grundies?

Yes, but each one remembers being chosen. They don't compete — they coexist.

*Field note:*

> Observed household with three spirits (Munchlet, Grib, Plompo). No territorial behavior. Munchlet seemed pleased by company. Grib occasionally hid Plompo's favorite sleeping spot. Plompo did not notice for three days.

### What Happens If Neglected

A Grundy won't die — that's not how spirits work. But they'll fade, grow distant, and eventually leave to find somewhere else. They can be called back with genuine care... but they remember.

*Warning found in margins of the Codex:*

> They forgive. They always forgive.
>
> But they don't forget.
>
> The bond, once broken, takes twice as long to rebuild.

### Do They Age?

They evolve, but they don't age the way living things do. A Grundy is as old as the moment that made them, and that moment is eternal.

*Theoretical framework:*

> A Grundy at Stage 1 is not "younger" than a Grundy at Stage 3. They are simply... less expressed. Evolution is not growth — it is *becoming more themselves*.

### The Central Mystery

*Final page of the Codex, handwriting increasingly unsteady:*

> I have studied them for years now.
>
> I understand their categories. Their preferences. Their behaviors.
>
> But the central question remains:
>
> **Why do they choose us?**
>
> They don't need us. Not really. They're spirits — they persist regardless.
>
> And yet they stay. They wait on windowsills. They drift through dream-cracks. They emerge from dying fires.
>
> They find homes that need them.
>
> Or perhaps — homes that they need.
>
> I asked a Munchlet once. Directly. "Why me?"
>
> It just hummed.
>
> Some questions aren't meant to be answered. Only lived.

## Implementation Notes

### Writing Style Guide

When writing additional lore fragments:

1. **Use found-document framing** — journals, reports, letters, transcripts
2. **Leave mysteries open** — don't over-explain
3. **Emotional truth over factual detail** — feelings matter more than mechanics
4. **Each pet has hidden depth** — surface personality masks something deeper
5. **Cozy, not dark** — melancholy is okay, tragedy is not

### Tone Keywords

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Mysterious | Scary |
| Melancholy | Depressing |
| Warm | Saccharine |
| Curious | Exposition-heavy |
| Earned emotion | Manipulative |

### Voice Examples

**Good:** *"It didn't answer. They never do. But something in its eyes suggested: longer than I want to remember."*

**Too dark:** *"The Munchlet had been abandoned, starving and alone, for months before anyone found it."*

**Too light:** *"Munchlet is super happy and loves everyone! Yay!"*
